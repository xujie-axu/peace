some tips to build a project
---------------------------------
### how to set info about this project.
Before push commit code to github, or other git repositoty, we have to set something about user info for git.

Especially, this project is built by many partners.

  So, we should open Terminal to write the config file.

  As follows:

  - open the config file, to see local project contributor info:

  ```ruby
    vim .git/config
  ```

  if there is nothing in the file, then:

  - config the user like this:

  ```ruby
    git config --local user.email "email@example.com"
    git config --local user.name "your_name"
  ```
